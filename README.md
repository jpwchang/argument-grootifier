#Cloud-to-Butt: Firefox Edition
A fork of Cloud-To-Butt Firefox Edition (https://github.com/Andrew-William-Smith/Cloud-to-Butt-Firefox) that replaces various phrases commonly found in flame wars with variations of "I AM GROOT". Now instead of imagining the internet as filled with unreasonably angry people yelling at their scrrens, you can instead imagine it as filled with gentle tree creatures :)
